1) Add google analytic to our gadget
2) Resizing does not work properly (starts small)
3) 7 +-2 items in the interface (make things disabled, change interface)
4) Loading label takes place and make the selection on nest row
   - make it absolute
5) the selection in small width screens is out of context
6) links on posts make the widget larger (width) and horizontal scroll is shown
   - Should make the links shorter ?! make the function which cut text global

	make it better
8) notifying on new/updated posts by making tab bold?! think.
9) publish our gadget on google
