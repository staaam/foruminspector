1) Add google analytic to our gadget
2) Resizing does not work properly (starts small)
3) 7 +-2 items in the interface (make things disabled, change interface)
4) Loading label takes place and make the selection on nest row
   - make it absolute
5) the selection in small width screens is out of context
6) links on posts make the widget larger (width) and horizontal scroll is shown
   - Should make the links shorter ?! make the function which cut text global
7) The meaning of selection on forum tab is different then on other tabs, should
	make it better
8) notifying on new/updated posts by making tab bold?! think.
