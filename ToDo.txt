1) Add google analytic to our gadget
2) Resizing does not work properly (starts small)
3) 7 +-2 items in the interface (make things disabled, change interface)
4) Loading label takes place and make the selection on nest row
   - make it absolute
5) the selection in small width screens is out of context
6) links on posts make the widget larger (width) and horizontal scroll is shown
   - Should make the links shorter ?! make the function which cut text global
7) The meaning of selection on forum tab is different then on other tabs, should
	make it better
8) notifying on new/updated posts by making tab bold?! think.
9) publish our gadget on google
10) headling of website sometimes is null should not write it in this case (or write the 
	link to the board
11) explicitly say what version of phpBB we are showing in the document/help
12) help button!!!
13) other buttons as said to be in the document (maybe not, think about interface)
14) enable vBulletin
15) add second css file
16) make the summary gadget (i.e. make some more tabs and just make another content 
feeder using remote messages between gadgets)
17) Think of database
18) add option for choosing which tabs to show
19) when forum is unselected automatically unselect it's choosen topics??! maybe maybe not?!
because when selecting it back all previous topics are shown?! maybe maybe not
20) add specifically what versions of what we are supporting, do more testing on other forums
