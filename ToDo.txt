-------------------------------------------------

--- Both ---
===	21) (Michael & Kolman) Add link to board name to the board itself		--> you can use board.url field to get the board url
=== 33) On each topic write from what forum it came.    --> topic.parent.title, topic.parent.url
=== 25) (Michael & Kolman) On topic view add author of each post.       --> Added fields author and details to post. Proposed subheader: labels.author + ": " + post.author + " ("+post.details+")"
=== 3) (Kolman) Make tabs highlight somehow color/bold (Forums and Starred)
=== 30) notifying on new/updated posts by making topic bold?! think.      --> Added funtcion to all elements isUpdated (returns false by default), for Topic - returns whether is has new posts or not. Proposed notification - bold the topic itself, probably notify also the tab (bold, italic, change color)
<<< (Michael) On new topics not seen, should highlight relevant tabs.	--> Added hidden user prefs which store which topics was last time in each tab. it is easy to implement which topics should be highlighted, how to give this information to display funciont?
	- topics: function( parentElem, boldTopics, topics ) 
13) other buttons as said to be in the document (maybe not, think about interface)
>>?	- (Kolman & Michael) Show All/Show Selected     --> currently I've put it to the setting area, do you think we should create the button for it? if so, it's your part :)  
===	- (Kolman & Michael) Refresh Content 			--> try making the button and calling ctrl.refresh() func, should work. I think right place to put it is near the Board Title (above all tabs), probably as a small picture (similar to refresh sign in browsers?)
=== 12) (Kolman) help button!!! 						--> I think right place to put it is near the Board Title (above all tabs), probably as a small picture (Question sign?)  OR in the About page (accessible in the same place as settings)  
	(Kolman & Michael) update inner text
<<<	34) (Kolman & Michael) Make is loading function + make loading display on title


--- Michael ---
11) Michael) add specifically what versions of what we are supporting, do more testing on other forums
    - http://mozilla.org.il/board/   -- phpBB3
=== - http://forums.mozillazine.org/
    - Check on many
18) (Michael) add option for choosing which tabs to show
22) (Michael) Add more preferences as promissed, TODO - what exact 
23) (Michael) Unstarring all topics in the Starred tab does not remove them from the tab
24) (Michael) When changing the address of the forum, clear all stored data
28) (Michael) When opening starred topic, gadget will show the last posts page and not first.
	(Michael) Add preferences for this
16) (Michael) PROBLEMATIC A LITTLE (at least, in the way we thought)  make the summary gadget (i.e. make some more tabs and just make another content feeder using remote messages between gadgets)



--- Kolman ---
==. 2) (Kolman) Resizing does not work properly (starts small) - Sometimes does not make it smaller.
27) Scroller in IE not working well	--> or is it low?
7) The meaning of selection on forum tab is different then on other tabs, should
	make it better
	- (Kolman) Not clear what checkboxes do, make them as stared picture
	- (Kolman) On forums checkbox meaning is: visible in other tabs (monitored)
26) (Kolman) formatting problem with hebrew topic names ending in English text.
	--> Test case: first forum in asat board (agudat studentim - aforum areshi), most views -> topic "P" :)
4) (Kolman) Loading label takes place and make the selection on nest row
   - make it absolute
29)	(Kolman) When showing posts one should understand that not all posts are shown
		also should understand that only the beginning or end is shown.
31) (Kolman) Left border it IE on topics is not shown.
32) (Kolman) Some look things as spaces after +
35) (Kolman) Line break should trim in titles of board and topics

--- Low ---
1) (Low) publish our gadget on google
		Add google analytic to our gadget
5) (Low) the selection in small width screens is out of context
6) (Low?) links on posts make the widget larger (width) and horizontal scroll is shown
   - Should make the links shorter ?! make the function which cut text global
14) (Low?) enable vBulletin
15) (Low) add second css file
17) (Low) Think of database

19) (Not) when forum is unselected automatically unselect it's choosen topics??! maybe maybe not?!
because when selecting it back all previous topics are shown?! maybe maybe not



--- Done ---
=== 10) (Michael) headling of website sometimes is null should not write it in this case (or write the link to the board
